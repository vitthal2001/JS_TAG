Connect Workday to Service no through API
OAuth 2.0 and Service Now
Hi General
 
I'm looking to talk to somebody who has experience of using OAuth 2.0 to authenticate Service Now to Workday and for ServiceNow to retrieve data from a RaaS report.  
 
The tech person on the client side says that he needs (along with the token and authorize URLs):
Client ID
Client Secret
Redirect URL
The Client id and redirect URL are on the "API Client" task but the Client Secret can not be found on this task
The Client ID and client Secret are on the "API Client for Integrations" task but the Redirect URL is not on this task
 
Is there any suggestions for which task to use so that Service Now can authenticate with Workday?
 
sean the client secret is only found on task register api client for integration 
 
that too while registering it for the first time
 
I know this is weird but we have to create both "API Client" and "API Client for Integrations" as ServiceNow suggested https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/xanadu-integrate-applications/page/administer/integrationhub-store-spokes/reference/configs-workday-hr-soap-oauth.html

Ideas
1.When I work on the web service I usaully gets something like Calendar_Year_ID and I dont know where to find this so I want to cretae the solution that when i enter this workday automatically gives me the object of the trype,



Add 365 days in date or minus 1 day in date
props['begin.date'] = props['p.ee.effdt']
props['days.to.add'] = 365
props['old.date'] = props['date.formatter.exit'].parse(props['begin.date'])
props['calendar'].setTime(props['old.date'])
props['calendar'].add(java.util.Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, props['days.to.add'])
props['p.ee.ELDleave+365'] = props['date.formatter.exit'].format(props['calendar'].getTime())





Hello 
General
,
 
One of my client has below requirement-
Data will be fetched from WD via report and it will be send via json request to external API (I am using HTTP POST method in studio).
They want this to run daily for full population.
 
I am facing below issue:
The report returns approx. 18,000 workers and when I try to accommodate these 18K workers in single JSON Request, it fails with error 'Sever Overloaded'. By reducing the record to 5,000 (added), it fails with error 'Size Exceed'. There might be a size limitation on the vendor's end but not sure what is the limit (I have asked them).
 
Is there any other efficient approach to push the json?
 
Another way I can think of - If there are 18K records, we can push the json request to API one at a time for each record. But with this approach there will be 18,000 connection attempts between Workday and Endpoint. Will this be an ideal approach to follow?

With Full Population, population will increase day by day and i think you need to send the data in batches of number of records accepted by vendor API in one call... There will be multiple hits to vendor API so check how much time integration takes to send all 18K records.

Hi Mrinal Manoj Manjarekar I worked on similar requirement earlier. I built code to send data in batches having 100 records in each. It worked without any issue. Vendor should confirm how many records they can accept in a batch. Based on their response, I suggest to use batch logic.

Core_Implementation_Service

It’s now possible to migrate X.509 Private Keys between your Implementation tenants through Customer Central.

The new feature is for the migration of Private Key Pairs ONLY. If you try to migrate Public Key Pairs, the migration fails and the Public Key Pair won’t be migrated to your target tenant.

You can run the Migrate x509 Private Key Pairs task to migrate x.509 key pairs between non-PROD tenants.  Refer to Workday Community <Migrate X.509 Private Key Pairs> article for more details.
